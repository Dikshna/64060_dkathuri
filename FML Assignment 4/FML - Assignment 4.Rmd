#Interpret the clusters in light of the numerical variables that were utilised to create them.

#Cluster 1 - AGN, PHA, BAY - These have the highest PE_Ratio. By observing the mean values of all quantitative variables for each cluster. The ROE value is poor.
#JNJ, MRK, GSK, and PFE are in Cluster_2 and have the biggest market capitalization and good leverage value.
#AHM, AVE, and WPI are in Cluster_3, they have the lowest beta and asset turnover.
#Cluster 4: The lowest market capitalization, leverage, and beta are exhibited by IVX, MRX, ELN, and CHTT.
#They're good. Its revenue growth is the highest.
#Cluster 5: ABT, NVS, AZN, LLY, BMY, WYE, SGP - These companies have the largest net profit margin, the biggest asset turnover, and the lowest sales growth.

#Do the clusters exhibit any patterns in relation to the numerical variables (10â€“12)? (those not utilized in cluster formation)

#For cluster 1: It should be held in accordance with media recommendations as it has the highest PE Ratio.
#For cluster 2: It has a good leverage value and the largest market capitalization. Additionally, they can be rather violent.
#For cluster 3: Its beta and asset turnover are the lowest. However, media endorsements are very positive.
#For cluster 4: They come with a modest recommendation despite the high leverage ratio.
#For Cluster 5: They have the largest net profit margin, the highest asset turnover, and the lowest revenue growth.


#3
#Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset.
#Cluster 1: Hold cluster
#Cluster 2: Mild Purchase or Hold a cluster.
#Cluster 3: Purchase or Sell
#Cluster 4: Purchase Cluster
#Cluster 5: High Hold Cluster
